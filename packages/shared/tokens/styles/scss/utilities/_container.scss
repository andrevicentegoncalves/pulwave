    // Assuming we want generic names or user defined?
    // Let's provide some generic ones.

    // We can allow arbitrary names via custom CSS usually, but utilities might need a few defaults.
    // Or we loop if we had tokens. Since we don't have explicit container-name tokens in the standard set usually:

    // .container-name-none
    .#{$utility-prefix}container-name-none#{$utility-suffix} {
        container-name: none;

    // We could iterate over spacing scale to create unique names like 'p-4'? No that's confusing.
    // Let's stick to the types for now as that's the main requirement.
