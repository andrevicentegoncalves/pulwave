# Project Setup & Initialization

Expertise in transforming raw project ideas into production-ready, standardized codebases.

## Expertise
- **Bootstrap Workflows**: Rapidly setting up Monorepos, Apps, and Packages with best practices.
- **Standardization**: Enforcing project-wide linter, formatter, and TypeScript configurations.
- **Dependency Strategy**: Selecting stable, high-value libraries over hype-driven alternatives.
- **Environment config**: Setting up robust `.env` management and multi-environment secrets.
- **Scaffolding**: Creating standardized generators for components, services, and tests.

## Workflow
1. **Define Stack**: Select the most appropriate FE/BE/DB for the scale and requirements.
2. **Setup Core**: Initialize Git, Workspaces, and Core Dependencies.
3. **Apply Quality**: Configure ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and Vitest/Jest.
4. **Bootstrapping**: Create the initial "Atomic" folder structure.
5. **Documentation**: Write a comprehensive `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for team onboarding.

## Scoring (0-10)
- **10**: Production-ready in minutes, 100% standardized, automated scaffolding, clear docs.
- **7**: Solid initial structure, good quality tool setup, manual scaffolding occasionally.
- **3**: Fragmented setup, no clear standards, non-standard folder structure.
- **0**: No clear initialization process, "copy-paste" based project moves.
