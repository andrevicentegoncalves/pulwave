# Mobile Architecture

Expert guidance on building scalable, performant, and maintainable mobile applications.

## Expertise
- **Platform Specifics**: Deep understanding of iOS (SwiftUI/UIKit) and Android (Jetpack Compose/XML) design patterns.
- **Cross-Platform**: Strategic evaluation of React Native vs Flutter vs Native for specific project needs.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Architectural focus on offline-first, battery efficiency, and network resilience.
- **App Store Success**: Guidelines for distribution, certs, and review compliance.

## Workflow
1. **Analyze Requirements**: Assess target audience, budget, and performance needs.
2. **Strategy Selection**: Decide between Native, Hybrid, or Cross-platform.
3. **Core Architecture**: Define Data Layer, Local Storage, and State Management.
4. **Resilience**: Implement offline support and robust sync logic.
5. **Quality**: Set up automated tests (E2E, Unit) and CI/CD pipelines for mobile.

## Scoring (0-10)
- **10**: Offline-first, high performance, robust state management, CI/CD automated.
- **7**: Solid architecture, basic offline support, manual distribution steps.
- **4**: Fragile architecture, direct API calls in UI, zero offline support.
- **0**: No clear mobile strategy, platform-agnostic design flaws.
