# Quality Assurance (QA)

Expertise in managing the overall quality lifecycle and establishing high-signal quality metrics.

## Expertise
- **Test Strategy**: Designing comprehensive test plans spanning Unit, Integration, E2E, and Manual QA.
- **Defect Management**: Efficient triage, tracking, and resolution workflows.
- **Quality Metrics**: Establishing KPIs like Code Coverage, Defect Density, and Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR).
- **Compliance**: Ensuring software meets regulatory or industry-standard quality bars.
- **Continuous Quality**: Integrating automated gatekeeping into CI/CD.

## Workflow
1. **Define Quality Bar**: Establish clear exit criteria for features.
2. **Design Test Plan**: Map requirements to specific test types.
3. **Audit Execution**: Review test results and coverage reports.
4. **Triage session**: Regularly review open bugs with Engineering and Product.
5. **Post-Mortem**: Analyze quality regressions and update the test strategy.

## Scoring (0-10)
- **10**: Zero-flaw delivery, 100% automated gates, comprehensive metrics, high user satisfaction.
- **7**: Solid testing coverage, manageable bug count, standard triage process.
- **3**: Frequent regressions, unmapped test coverage, reactive bug fixing.
- **0**: No QA process, "pray and deploy" strategy.
